# Eyes Exercise
Move your mouse around the browser window and watch as the eyes track your cursor, blinking curiously as they look.

<img src="Eyes.gif" width='400' />

# How to Run:
* Download the repository, which should include eyes.js, index.html. and styles.css.
* Open the html in your browswer and the eyes will start following your cursor automatically and blinking.

# Roadmap to Improvement:
I would like to really push some more interactive visualizations and reactions from the "eyes" by:
* Adding a mouth that opens wider based on cursor proximity, maybe even tries to eat it?
* Add coding that allows the eyes to cross when the cursor is centered between them.
